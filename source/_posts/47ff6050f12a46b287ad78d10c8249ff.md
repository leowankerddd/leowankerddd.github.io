Zoom Team Chat channels allow users to collaborate in groups, either publicly or privately. Hereâ€™s how they work:

### **Public Channels**

- **Visibility & Access:** Public channels are searchable and joinable by all members within a Zoom account. No special invitation is required.
- **Membership:** Any user within the account can join a public channel, but existing members can also add others.
- **External Users:** Public channels are specific to an account, meaning external users cannot find them unless explicitly added by an admin.
- **Capacity:** Public channels can have up to **10,000 members**, but account admins can request an increase to **50,000 members**[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb\&sysparm_article=KB0063548\&citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1").

### **Private Channels**

- **Visibility & Access:** Private channels are hidden from non-members. They cannot be searched or discovered by users who are not already part of the channel.
- **Membership:** Only existing members can add new users to a private channel.
- **External Users:** External contacts can be added if permitted by admins.
- **Capacity:** Private channels on **paid accounts** can have up to **5,000 members**, while private channels on **free accounts** are limited to **500 members**[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb\&sysparm_article=KB0063548\&citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1").

### **Joining & Managing Channels**

- **Joining Public Channels:** Users can browse available public channels in the Zoom desktop app and join them instantly.
- **Joining Private Channels:** Users must be invited by an existing member.
- **Admin Controls:** Admins can manage channels via the Zoom web portal, including assigning users, adjusting permissions, and exporting channel information[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb\&sysparm_article=KB0061189\&citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2").
